# Business Site

The aim of this project was to demonstrate competency in creating and designing a form within the context of a business site.

I chose to use a real business run by someone I know. My goal was to improve on an existing concept and realize the company’s vision. My approach began with inviting the business owner over for coffee. In this case, the business is my husband’s former cover band, and the band leader is our friend who lives across the street. We brainstormed necessary features for the new and improved website, and he showed me websites of other bands, highlighting elements he liked.

I used ChatGPT whenever I had an idea for something I didn’t know how to implement. For instance, my client asked if I could make the logo rotate 360 degrees. I had no idea if that was possible, but ChatGPT provided some code that I tested, and it worked. I got other ideas from some of the material in class meetings and team labs, such as using videos as a background and creating a gradient effect. I also applied techniques from last week’s project, like using flexbox and grid to create the layout. I also found a YouTube video that helped me create a favicon. 

If I had more time, I would experiment more with styling, such as trying different fonts. I would also like to update the review boxes so that on mobile, it fits 4 or 5 boxes, but as the screen enlarges, more boxes are added, and they can appear in a different grid design with some boxes in various shapes. I would also add more media, like a photo carousel.
